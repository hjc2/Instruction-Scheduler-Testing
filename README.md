# Batch running files

this is for the compilers class Fall 2023 project 4

## How to run

move the grap.sh file into your repo.

run the following command in your repo.

`$ ./grap.sh blocks`

that would run it on the blocks folder.

you could also do

`$ ./grap.sh blocks/report`

or

`$ ./grap.sh blocks/report/`

or

`$ ./grap.sh blocks/timing/`

really whatever

# Comparing files

run the command 

`$ ./compare.sh myBlocksDirectory otherBlocksDirectory`

where both of these have output files in them.

**only files that are in both directories will be compared.**

**this only checks if two files are anagrams.**

*problem is, we might all assign edges differently. but realistically if your weights are correct that's the important part.*
